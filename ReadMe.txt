This app was made as a response to coronavirus, (COVID-19).
Yonge Street Mission (YSM), the organization I am working with is responding to Covid-19 by providing grocery bags and snacks for the community who are in need.
I have encountered difficulty tracking the number of people who visited YSM and the number of people we actually serve. 
Visitors can take a total of two set of snacks for them(singular) and for one person in their household.
Clickers can only count one variable at a time. Therefore I created this app to count two variables at the same time, number of visitors and numbe of actual people served.

This app was created to track these two variables at the same time.

I am at the beginning of my journey as a developer, therefore this app may need refractoring in the future.

However, it does the job.
